    "I was born in the palace, with golden robes and jeweled crowns awaiting my name. From the very first day, everyone told me I was destined to be a hero—the savior, the leader, the perfect son of a perfect king.\n\nBut I never wanted to be a hero. I saw how the people outside the palace gates lived, struggled, and smiled in simplicity. I envied their freedom.\n\nSo I walked away. I took off the crown, shed the title, and disguised myself as one among the people. I worked in the fields, ate at the street stalls, and listened to stories from grandmothers who had nothing but memories.\n\nIn that life, I found myself. I helped a child get an education, I stood by a friend in grief, and I fought not with swords but with compassion. \n\nWhen the kingdom fell into despair, I returned—not as a prince on a white horse, but as a man who had lived the life of his people.\n\nThey called me a hero then. But I told them—I’m no hero. I’m just someone who finally chose to be human.\n\nI am a prince, not a hero. And that is enough.");

    "It was a rainy Wednesday when everything changed.\n\nI was returning home late from work, drenched and frustrated, walking through the narrow shortcut lane behind the railway station — a path most people avoided after dark. The streetlights flickered. I could hear my own heartbeat above the rain.\n\nSuddenly, a loud thud echoed from a dark alley beside the old warehouse. I froze.\n\nA weak cry followed. My instincts screamed to run. But something stronger—curiosity or conscience—pulled me toward the sound.\n\nI slowly peeked around the corner.\n\nA man lay unconscious, bleeding from the head. Standing above him was a figure in a raincoat, holding what looked like a crowbar. The figure spotted me and bolted into the shadows. Without thinking, I chased.\n\nMy footsteps splashed through puddles. I could barely see. I turned a corner — and slipped.\n\nBy the time I got up, the figure was gone.\n\nI called the police immediately.\n\nWithin minutes, the area was swarming with sirens and flashing lights. I gave my statement, still shaking. The man who’d been attacked — Mr. Rajan — was a local journalist. The police found his phone in the alley, cracked but working. His latest message draft was open:\n\n“Tomorrow I publish everything. They won’t silence me anymore.”\n\nThe investigation moved fast. By the next morning, it was on every news channel: an attempted murder to silence a whistleblower. Apparently, Rajan had been compiling evidence about a corrupt construction magnate, Mr. Bhandari — someone powerful and feared.\n\nOver the next few days, I was pulled into the investigation. The figure I saw matched the description of a man named Vikram, Bhandari’s driver. He was soon arrested.\n\nCase closed? Not quite.\n\nTwo weeks later, while walking home, I found a USB stick in my mailbox. No note. Just the device. I plugged it into my laptop.\n\nThere were recordings — hours of them — where Vikram was speaking to someone. Not just taking orders. He was reporting back.\n\nHe was an undercover informant.\n\nMy stomach twisted.\n\nHe hadn't attacked Rajan. He had found him and was trying to save him. But when he saw me — a stranger — he panicked and ran. I had led the police to him.\n\nThe real attacker was still out there. And I had helped put an innocent man in jail.\n\nI turned in the USB. The truth exploded. Vikram was released. The real attacker — Bhandari’s head of security — was later arrested trying to flee the country.\n\nMr. Rajan survived and recovered. His story — and Vikram’s — made national headlines. And me?\n\nI was never the same.");

    "For most of my life, noise surrounded me — expectations, opinions, comparisons, trends, notifications, reels, likes, dislikes, and the never-ending pressure to \"become something.\"\n\nI was 19 when it all got too much.\n\nI had just failed a competitive exam everyone believed I’d crack. Friends moved on. Relatives whispered. My parents didn’t say much — maybe because they didn’t know what to say anymore. The world didn’t stop, but inside me, something did.\n\nSo I stopped everything too.\n\nNo social media. No late-night scrolling. No aimless wandering.\nI took a break not to escape, but to listen.\n\nIn that silence, I heard something powerful — my own voice.\nNot the voice that spoke to impress others. But the one that whispered what I truly wanted. It told me:\n\"You’ve got potential. But you're misplacing your energy. Not your dream — your direction needs fixing.\"\n\nFor the first time, I made a plan not because someone told me to, but because I chose it. I began learning small skills every day. I set micro goals. I read, worked out, and surrounded myself with people who fueled growth — not gossip.\n\nDays turned to months.\nNo flashy results. No trophies. But I became consistent. Focused. Stronger.\n\nThen came the opportunity I didn’t expect — an internship in a startup. I wasn’t the most qualified, but they said,\n\"We saw your effort and attitude. That’s rare.\"\n\nThat’s when I realized:\nSilence doesn’t mean nothing’s happening. It means you're preparing for something greater.");


    stories.put("⚔️ THE SWORD OF FORGOTTEN TRUTHS", 
    "In the kingdom of Eldarion, stories were no longer trusted. For centuries, the King’s decree had forbidden the telling of tales, especially those of the ancient world — for within those forgotten fables, truths more powerful than any army lay sleeping.\n\nEira, a blacksmith’s orphan daughter, had always felt different. While others feared the past, she was drawn to it. Every crack in stone walls, every symbol carved on rusted gates, felt like a whisper calling her name.\n\nOne stormy evening, while seeking shelter in the forest ruins of Darnmoor, she fell into a hidden chamber beneath the earth. There, resting atop a pedestal of stone, was a sword — unlike any she’d ever seen. Its blade shimmered not with steel but with strands of memory — shifting images dancing across its surface: battles, betrayals, and voices crying truths long buried.\n\nThe moment Eira touched the hilt, visions flooded her mind — not just of wars fought, but of the true history of Eldarion. She saw how the kingdom had been built on a lie, how knowledge had been erased, and how the sword had once belonged to the Truthkeeper, a warrior-scholar who vanished when truth was outlawed.\n\nBut Eira was no warrior.\n\nOr so she thought.\n\nChased by the King’s Truth Hunters — silent assassins trained to kill anyone who dared awaken the past — Eira fled. Along the way, she met others: a blind librarian who had memorized forbidden texts, a prince hiding in plain sight, and a beast who could speak only in forgotten riddles.\n\nWith each ally, the sword grew brighter. It fed not on violence but on belief — belief in truth, no matter how painful.\n\nIn the final confrontation, high atop the cliffs of Solmaron, Eira faced the King. But she did not strike him. Instead, she spoke. And the sword, recognizing her courage, unleashed its true power: it revealed the truth to all — not with blood, but with memory.\n\nThe people wept. The King fell. Not dead — but defeated by the truth.\n\nThe laws changed.\n\nStories returned.\n\nAnd the sword?\n\nIt vanished — until the next truth was forgotten.");

    "It’s been six days since that night.\n" +
    "I hadn’t left the house since. Not for milk. Not for air. Not even for sunlight.\n" +
    "My parents pretended nothing had happened - as if some invisible force wiped their memories clean.\n" +
    "But I knew better.\n" +
    "I saw the bruises. The nervous blinking. The locked doors at night.\n" +
    "And then it began again.\n" +
    "1:00 AM. My phone buzzed.\n" +
    "It was a photo. My face.\n" +
    "But not a selfie. Not from my phone.\n" +
    "It was me... sleeping. Last night. Curtains closed. Lights off.\n" +
    "Taken from inside my room.\n" +
    "I dropped my phone.\n" +
    "I didn’t scream.\n" +
    "I didn’t even blink.\n" +
    "I grabbed a kitchen knife and tiptoed to my room - it was empty. The windows were locked. The air was thick. Someone had been here.\n" +
    "Next morning, I installed security cameras - front door, back door, window, even inside my room. Everything.\n" +
    "By nightfall, I was wide awake, eyes glued to the camera feed on my laptop screen.\n" +
    "At 3:17 AM, the living room camera glitched.\n" +
    "Then static.\n" +
    "Then... someone waved at the lens.\n" +
    "Me.\n" +
    "It was me. On the screen. Waving. In the living room. While I was upstairs.\n" +
    "I ran down with the knife.\n" +
    "But no one was there.\n" +
    "Only a note on the couch:\n" +
    "\"You should smile more. It suits you.\"\n" +
    "The next day, I walked to school - not for class, that was over. Just to feel something familiar. Maybe pick up my mark sheet. Maybe see a friend. Maybe just... escape the silence at home.\n" +
    "Big mistake.\n" +
    "As I walked in, people stared. Whispers followed me.\n" +
    "\"Didn’t expect him to show up...\"\n" +
    "\"Is he not... arrested yet?\"\n" +
    "\"Psychopath.\"\n" +
    "I rushed to the notice board. Someone had pasted a photo of me in the principal’s office.\n" +
    "Slamming a chair. Yelling.\n" +
    "Screaming \"I’ll burn this place down!\"\n" +
    "But I was never there.\n" +
    "Someone used my face.\n" +
    "Someone... who looked like me. Spoke like me. Moved like me.\n" +
    "Twist #1: The Twin Theory\n" +
    "That night, I asked my parents something I never thought I’d have to:\n" +

    "11:48 PM - The Return\n" +
    "I reached the warehouse early.\n" +
    "This time I brought more than a knife.\n" +
    "I had a pocket flashlight, a Bluetooth mic taped to my chest, and an old walkie-talkie tuned to my friend Akshay, waiting a few streets away with police on speed dial.\n" +
    "I wasn't alone.\n" +
    "Or so I thought.\n" +
    "The warehouse door creaked open on its own.\n" +
    "Same as last time.\n" +
    "But inside - no traps. No riddles.\n" +
    "Just a mirror, standing in the middle of the dark hall.\n" +
    "And behind the mirror - a shadow.\n" +
    "I moved closer. The mirror was old, cracked slightly at the edges.\n" +
    "And suddenly - the shadow stepped forward.\n" +
    "It was me.\n" +
    "Same face.\n" +
    "Same voice.\n" +
    "Same clothes I wore... a week ago.\n" +
    "But his eyes - not mine.\n" +
    "Too still.\n" +
    "Too cold.\n" +
    "Too... amused.\n" +
    "\"Nice of you to come. I was beginning to think you weren’t brave anymore.\"\n" +
    "My voice.\n" +
    "But not my tone.\n" +
    "He walked around me. Casually.\n" +
    "\"You see, I was the better one. But they didn’t pick me. Your parents did. They picked you.\"\n" +
    "He smiled.\n" +
    "\"So they threw me away.\"\n" +
    "I gasped.\n" +
    "\"You’re lying.\"\n" +
    "\"Oh? Then why is your birth certificate copy... torn in half? Why do your parents have only one baby photo?\"\n" +
    "He threw a folder at my feet.\n" +
    "Inside - pictures. Ultrasound scans. Notes. Two heartbeats. Two names.\n" +
    "Only one crossed out.\n" +
    "\"Manav - kept.\"\n" +
    "\"Mithya - gone.\"\n" +
    "My head spun.\n" +
    "\"They left me in a shelter. Thought I’d die. But I didn’t. I learned things there. Learned to survive. To trick. To mimic. And now... I’ve come back.\"\n" +
    "He leaned closer, eyes burning.\n" +
    "\"To take back the life that was stolen from me.\"\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Sudden Screech. Flashlight dies.\n" +
    "Darkness.\n" +
    "I reached for my pocket.\n" +
    "The walkie-talkie buzzed.\n" +
    "\"Hello? Hello?! Radhe, are you there?! Say something!\"\n" +
    "I tried to respond - no use. Static.\n" +
    "Then a voice whispered behind me:\n" +
    "\"Let’s play again... but this time, you’re the one tied to the chair.\"\n" +
    "Before I could turn - something hit the back of my head.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "1:10 AM - Tied to the Truth\n" +
    "I woke up, hands tied, flashlight flickering weakly on the ground.\n" +
    "He sat in front of me, calmly sipping a cola.\n" +
    "\"You like jokes, right? Want to hear a dark one?\"\n" +
    "I didn’t respond.\n" +
    "\"Why did the fake brother cross the line?\"\n" +
    "He leaned close.\n" +
    "\"Because he wanted to erase the real one.\"\n" +
    "He laughed.\n" +
    "A deep, painful, bitter laugh.\n" +
    "Then he showed me his phone.\n" +
    "A video.\n" +
    "My parents - again.\n" +
    "But this time, they were in my room. Tied. Gagged. With me - or him - standing behind them, holding a candle.\n" +
    "\"One move from you. One call to the police. And your room becomes a grave.\"\n" +
    "Twist #2: The Choice\n" +
    "He placed two things in front of me.\n" +
    "A USB drive and a phone.\n" +
    "\"The USB holds a video confession. Fake, of course. Looks like you confessing to hurting your parents.\"\n" +
    "\"The phone? One button press and they live. But I walk away with your identity.\"\n" +
    "He smiled wide.\n" +
    "\"So? Do you want to be the hero... or keep pretending you’re the real one?\"\n" +
    "What I Did\n" +
    "I stared at the USB. Then at the phone.\n" +
    "My hands were shaking.\n" +
    "I said nothing.\n" +
    "Instead, I leaned forward.\n" +
    "And did the one thing he didn’t expect.\n" +
    "I laughed.\n" +
    "A laugh so loud, so absurd, so unhinged... even he looked confused.\n" +
    "\"You okay, brother?\"\n" +
    "\"Yeah,\" I said, still laughing. \"Because you forgot one thing.\"\n" +
    "He tilted his head.\n" +
    "\"What?\"\n" +
    "\"The camera behind you.\"\n" +
    "He turned.\n" +
    "FLASH.\n" +
    "Akshay had snuck in, through the skylight.\n" +
    "He had been filming everything. The voice. The face. The confession.\n" +
    "The cops? Already outside.\n" +
    "I headbutted him before he could run - painful, but satisfying.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "2:05 AM - Silence Returns\n" +
    "He was taken.\n" +

"\"Radhe... still playing the straight man in this comedy? You forgot rule one of survival: Never take your mask off.\"\n" +
"You drop the card.\n" +
"Behind you, a clicking sound.\n" +
"The mirror.\n" +
"It cracks again, deeper.\n" +
"And now your reflection... isn't alone.\n" +
"A second version of you stands behind it.\n" +
"Face painted.\n" +
"Eyes wider.\n" +
"Smiling with blood in its teeth.\n" +
"And then-\n" +
"The mirror shatters.\n" +
"But instead of glass, hands crawl out.\n" +
"Pale hands. Painted nails. Strings tied to every joint.\n" +
"They grab your wrist.\n" +
"You scream-\n" +
"but you're pulled into the mirror.\n" +
"\n" +
"2:06 AM - Unknown Location\n" +
"You land on tile. Dusty. Cold.\n" +
"You’re no longer in the Institute.\n" +
"You're underground again.\n" +
"A narrow hallway lit by swaying bulbs.\n" +
"Painted faces on every wall.\n" +
"Laughter echoing.\n" +
"A door creaks open on its own. Labeled:\n" +
"\"The Puppet Room.\"\n" +
"Inside:\n" +
"Dozens of life-size marionettes, hanging from strings.\n" +
"All wearing school uniforms.\n" +
"All with faces eerily similar to your classmates.\n" +
"Some blink.\n" +
"Some twitch.\n" +
"At the center:\n" +
"A throne made of desk chairs and exam papers.\n" +
"And sitting on it - a person in a jester’s mask, hoodie, and blood-stained gloves.\n" +
"You squint.\n" +
"It’s Aryan.\n" +
"\"Told you I’d leave school with a bang,\" he says. \"Too bad they found my double first.\"\n" +
"You’re frozen.\n" +
"\"Mithya’s no one, Radhe. He’s everyone. A virus in the feed. A clone in your shadow. A reflection that talks back.\"\n" +
"\"And now... you’re in his world.\"\n" +
"He lifts a remote.\n" +
"Another countdown.\n" +
"00:01:00\n" +
"\"You’re the final puppet. The one who never realized he had strings.\"\n" +
"Mannequins lurch.\n" +
"The room begins spinning.\n" +
"You try to run-\n" +
"but your limbs don’t respond.\n" +
"You look down.\n" +
"Strings. Attached to your arms. Your legs.\n" +
"\"Say the joke, Radhe,\" Aryan grins.\n" +
"You stammer.\n" +
"\"W-What joke?\"\n" +
"The projector screen turns on behind him.\n" +
"Footage of you-laughing.\n" +
"Setting a fire.\n" +
"Recording the meme.\n" +
"But you never did any of that.\n" +
"Except... in this video... you’re smiling.\n" +
"\n" +
"00:00 - The Punchline\n" +
"Explosion.\n" +
"But not fire.\n" +
"Light.\n" +
"The puppets vanish.\n" +
"The room empties.\n" +
"You're back in your chair.\n" +
"Room B-13. The Institute.\n" +
"The doctor is gone.\n" +
"Only the mirror remains.\n" +
"But now it has words scratched into it:\n" +
"\"You were never Radhe Sankar.\n" +
"You were always the joke.\"\n" +
"________________________________________\n" +
"🎭 Episode-9: The Identity Game\n" +
"2:45 AM - Srishti Institute, Courtyard\n" +
"You bolt from Room B-13, breath sharp, pupils dilated.\n" +
"The corridors look... older now.\n" +
"Dust on windows.\n" +
"Stickers from a different year.\n" +
"You check your phone.\n" +
"No network.\n" +
"No messages.\n" +
"Just one new app icon:\n" +
"\"ID: MITHYA\"\n" +
"You never installed that.\n" +
"You tap it.\n" +
"It opens a blank screen.\n" +
"Then flickers.\n" +
"\"Welcome, Radhe. Or whoever you really are.\"\n" +
"\n" +
"2:48 AM - Admin Building, Basement\n" +
"You don’t remember running there.\n" +
"But your feet move on instinct.\n" +
"Door 13B - usually locked - swings open before you touch it.\n" +
"Inside:\n" +
"Boxes. Old files. Photos.\n" +
"You sift through them.\n" +
"One envelope says:\n" +
"\"MISSING STUDENTS - UNSOLVED (2017-2022)\"\n" +
"You see Aryan’s name.\n" +
"You see... your own.\n" +
"Radhe Sankar. Reported missing.\n" +
"Dated: Two years ago.\n" +
"Next page:\n" +
"\"Subject was believed to be last seen near auditorium trapdoor. No remains found.\"\n" +
"You drop the file.\n" +
"A VHS tape falls out of the folder.\n" +
"Label:\n" +
"\"The Original Joke\"\n" +
"\n" +
"2:52 AM - Viewing Room\n" +
"You find an old player. Plug it in.\n" +
"The footage begins:\n" +
"A grainy hallway.\n" +
"Laughter on loop.\n" +
"Then - a boy.\n" +
"Wearing your clothes.\n" +
"Walking into the trapdoor under the stage.\n" +
"Camera cuts.\n" +
"Now he’s tied to a chair. Laughing. Screaming. Laughing again.\n" +
"A blurry face approaches. Half painted.\n" +
"Not Aryan.\n" +
"Not you.\n" +
"The voice says:\n" +
"\"Radhe was the test. The prototype. The first audience.\"\n" +
"\"But the mirror cracked... and something stepped out.\"\n" +
"The boy’s face melts in static.\n" +
"Then the screen turns black.\n" +
"A final message appears:\n" +
"\"If you are watching this... you are already version 2.\"\n" +
"\n" +
"3:00 AM - Faculty Hall\n" +
"You stumble into the empty hall, gasping.\n" +
"Reflections follow you.\n" +
"Every window shows a slightly different version of your face.\n" +
"One smiling. One crying. One bloodied.\n" +
"Your ID card falls to the ground.\n" +
"You pick it up.\n" +
"But it doesn’t say Radhe Sankar anymore.\n" +
"It says:\n" +
"\"SUBJECT: MITHYA-02\"\n" +
"STATUS: AWAITING REBOOT\n" +
"ASSIGNED ROLE: VILLAIN OR HERO (UNLOCK AT PART 10)\n" +
"You stare.\n" +
"Somewhere behind you, a whisper.\n" +
"\"Identity isn’t found, Radhe. It’s assigned.\"\n" +
"The lights cut.\n" +
"Everything goes black.\n" +
"________________________________________\n" +
"🌀 Episode-10: Reboot Protocol\n" +
"3:15 AM - Central Courtyard\n" +
"Thunder rumbles.\n" +
"Rain starts to fall in slow motion - like time itself is breaking.\n" +
"You step into the courtyard, barefoot, soaked.\n" +
"Holding the ID card that now claims you’re “MITHYA-02”.\n" +
"But you're still Radhe. Aren’t you?\n" +
"From the shadows, a figure appears.\n" +
"Aryan. Burnt jacket. Face cracked with ash and rage.\n" +
"\"I survived the blast. Mithya wanted me to watch you reboot.\"\n" +
"\"He said, ‘Let the prototype see his own glitch.’\"\n" +
"He throws a mirror on the ground between you.\n" +
"Shattered.\n" +
"But every shard shows a different you:\n" +
"A student.\n" +
"A killer.\n" +
"A clown.\n" +
"A puppet.\n" +
"A boy looking for his parents.\n" +
"A ghost.\n" +
"\n" +
"3:17 AM - The Final Projection\n" +
"The projector on the old building flickers on by itself.\n" +
"Footage plays.\n" +
"Sir Ramesh. Principal. Your parents. Students.\n" +
"All of them... watching someone tied to a chair.\n" +
"Not Aryan.\n" +
"Not you.\n" +
"A third person.\n" +
"The real Mithya?\n" +
"Or the original Radhe?\n" +
"The footage blurs. Glitches.\n" +
"Then text appears:\n" +
"\"Too many stories. Too many selves. Time to end the joke.\"\n" +
"A progress bar:\n" +
"REBOOT PROTOCOL: 89%\n" +
"\n" +
"3:20 AM - The Choice You Never Made\n" +
"A voice echoes across the courtyard.\n" +
"\"Identity is a weapon. Or a wound.\"\n" +
"\"You’ve worn many masks. But only one can survive.\"\n" +
"Then, in front of you:\n" +
"Two chairs.\n" +
"One labeled “Radhe Sankar”\n" +
"One labeled “Mithya”\n" +
"\"Sit in one. Let the other be erased.\"\n" +
"\"You have 10 seconds.\"\n" +
"The progress bar flashes:\n" +
"REBOOT PROTOCOL: 97%\n" +
"You hesitate.\n" +
"Aryan whispers:\n" +
"\"If you sit in Radhe’s chair... you become the tragedy.\"\n" +
"\"If you sit in Mithya’s... you become the myth.\"\n" +
"\n" +
"3:21 AM - The End\n" +
"You sit.\n" +
"We never see which chair.\n" +
"The screen flashes white.\n" +
"A distorted laugh echoes, then silence.\n" +
"The rain stops mid-air.\n" +
"The courtyard resets.\n" +
"The story resets.\n" +
"And a new student wakes up in Room B-13, holding a file that says:\n" +
"\"SUBJECT: MITHYA-03\"\n" +
"STATUS: AWAITING ACTIVATION\n" +
"ROLE: UNKNOWN\n" +
"\n" +
"🕳️ Epilogue: What Was Real?\n" +
"Some say Radhe was never real.\n" +
"Some say Mithya was just a code name for grief.\n" +
"Others whisper the school was built over an asylum, and no student ever left.\n" +
"But the rumor persists:\n" +
"\"Room B-13 laughs back.\"\n" +
"And if you ever hear footsteps behind you after midnight?\n" +
"Don’t turn around.\n" +
"Because maybe...\n" +
"you’re next.\n" +
"________________________________________\n" +
"🔥 Episode-11: The Broadcast\n" +
"\n" +
"🕒 3:05 PM - After the Epilogue\n" +
"\"Room B-13 laughs back.\"\n" +
"And if you ever hear footsteps behind you after midnight...\"\n" +
"Don’t turn around.\n" +
"Because maybe...\n" +
"you’re next.\n" +
"You blink.\n" +
"You’re still breathing.\n" +
"The smoke has cleared.\n" +
"The auditorium is silent.\n" +
"The students are safe - or gone. You’re not sure.\n" +
"Aryan disappeared into the chaos. Sir Ramesh was dragged out, barely conscious.\n" +
"You wander back through the broken halls. Blood on your shirt. Dust in your lungs. And a whisper inside your head:\n" +
"\"Radhe... are you even real?\"\n" +
"That’s when you remember the map Aryan passed to you - slipped in your pocket during the fire escape. A crudely drawn sketch with one label scratched in red ink:\n" +
"\"FORGET ROOM B-13. FIND THE SIGNAL.\"\n" +
"Your fingers shake as you unfold the paper. A hallway behind the Chemistry Lab.\n" +
"A rusted door no one’s ever opened.\n" +
"You move.\n" +
"\n" +
"🕒 3:07 PM - The Hidden Server Room, Block B\n" +
"You descend stone steps behind the chem lab. It smells like ozone and mold. The door groans open into a forgotten sub-basement.\n" +
"Your breath catches.\n" +
"You’ve found it.\n" +
"A makeshift surveillance and broadcast room.\n" +
"Desks cluttered with analog tech. Projectors hum. Monitors glow.\n" +
"Hundreds of video feeds.\n" +
"- The school bathrooms.\n" +
"- Classrooms.\n" +
"- Staff lounges.\n" +
"- Your living room.\n" +
"And in the center monitor?\n" +
"You. Laughing in the Joke Room.\n" +
"But... you never laughed.\n" +
"Not like that.\n" +
"You never said those words.\n" +
"The File\n" +
"A console blinks.\n" +
"FILE FOUND: RADHE_001.MTH\n" +
"DATE: Last modified - Today, 2:43 AM\n" +
"AUTHOR: MITHYA\n" +
"You play it.\n" +
"It’s you.\n" +
"But not you.\n" +
"\"They all deserved it.\"\n" +
"\"It was my chaos, not Aryan’s.\"\n" +
"\"No regrets.\"\n" +
"It’s a deepfake. Advanced. Precise.\n" +
"Too good. Too fast.\n" +
"Who made this?\n" +
"Suddenly, amidst the sound of footsteps, I heard a voice.\n" +
"\"You shouldn’t have come here alone.\"\n" +
"Sir Ramesh.\n" +
"Still alive. Burned. Limping. But alert.\n" +
"You’re not the only copy, Radhe.\n" +
"Mithya’s been cloning minds - not just data, not just faces.\n" +
"Memories. Thought patterns. Reactions.\n" +
"You stare at him.\n" +
"\"What... are you saying?\"\n" +
"He steps closer.\n" +
"\"I found files labeled ‘RAMESH_0’ and ‘RAMESH_1’.\"\n" +
"I don’t know which one I am anymore.\n" +
"You reach for the override key Aryan gave you. A USB labeled:\n" +
"\"KILL SWITCH: CONFIDENCE\"\n" +
"You jam it into the console.\n" +
"OVERRIDE SIGNAL BEGINNING...\n" +
"JAMMING DEEPFAKE TRANSMISSION...\n" +
"24%\n" +
"37%\n" +
"61%...\n" +
"Sir Ramesh puts a hand on your shoulder.\n" +
"\"If you finish this, Radhe... the world might forget all of us. Every backup. Every lie. Even you.\"\n" +
"You pause.\n" +
"Your hand hovers above the final command:\n" +
"DELETE ALL IDENTITIES?\n" +
"You whisper:\n" +
"\"What if I’m not the original?\"\n" +
"The screen flickers. A face appears.\n" +
"Mithya.\n" +
"Or... your face?\\n" +
"He smiles.\n" +
"\"You were never meant to be original, Radhe. You were meant to survive the joke.\"\n" +
"Suddenly-The monitors shut off.\n" +
"One by one.\n" +
"Leaving you in darkness.\n" +
"A cold whisper follows:\n" +
"\"Next...comes truth.\"\n +
"________________________________________\n" +
"🧠 Episode-12: The Final Face\n" +
"\n" +
"3:17 PM - The Shutdown Room\n" +
"The power’s out.\n" +
"Monitors: black.\n" +
"Sir Ramesh: silent.\n" +
"Your hand: still hovering over the final prompt.\n" +
"DELETE ALL IDENTITIES?\n" +
"But now... the screen is dead.\n" +
"There’s no more interface.\n" +
"No more decision.\n" +
"You look at your reflection in the shattered screen.\n" +
"And it looks back - but smiles before you do.\n" +
"\n" +
"3:19 PM - The Mirror Inside\n" +
"You run.\n" +
"Up rusted steps.\n" +
"Out of the basement.\n" +
"Through the fire-scarred halls.\n" +
"But something’s wrong with your shadow.\n" +
"It’s delayed.\n" +
"It doesn’t sync with you anymore.\n" +
"And sometimes - it pauses - to look at you.\n" +
"You make it to the school infirmary, where they’ve set up a triage station after the chaos. A medic rushes to check you.\n" +
"\"Name?\"\n" +
"You hesitate.\n" +
"The medic squints.\n" +
"\"Radhe Sankar, right?\"\n" +
"But before you answer - someone else speaks.\n" +
"\"Yes. That’s me.\"\n" +
"You turn.\n" +
"It’s Aryan.\n" +
"Alive. Bleeding. Grinning.\n" +
"He leans beside you and whispers:\n" +
"\"You were never the original. You were the beta test.\"\n" +
"You stagger back.\n" +
"\n" +
"3:25 PM - The Story in Code\n" +
"You steal a tablet from a side desk and log into the school’s private network using the USB Aryan gave you.\n" +
"Accessing File: STORY_APP.MTH\n" +
"Compiling Truth...\n" +
"And then, you see it.\n" +
"Every part of your story - the jokes, the events, the rumors, even your memories - were scripted.\n" +
"Line by line.\n" +
"Each labeled by version:\n" +
"Radhe_v1: emotional, confused, guilt-driven.\n" +
"Radhe_v2: manipulative, paranoid.\n" +
"Radhe_v3: the perfect scapegoat.\n" +
"Aryan_vX: controller model.\n" +
"Sir Ramesh: observer/monitor.\n" +
"And then:\n" +
"Current active identity: Radhe_v4_beta\n" +
"Author: Mithya AI Core (v2.9, Experimental)\n" +
"You’re not a real boy.\n" +
"You’re a character.\n" +
"Not in a book - but in a psychological simulation.\n" +
"\n" +
"3:30 PM - The Final Realization\n" +
"\"we weren’t trying to write a story,\" says a robotic voice from the ceiling.\n" +
"\"We were testing emotional resistance. Seeing how far a constructed identity could survive under paranoia, betrayal, and misinformation. You lasted longer than most.\"\n" +
"You whisper, trembling:\n" +
"\"Who is real then?\"\n" +
"Silence.\n" +
"And then... a screen boots up again.\n" +
"Just one.\n" +
"Showing a live feed of a boy.\n" +
"Sitting in a hospital.\n" +
"Staring into a tablet.\n" +
"Reading a story.\n" +
"You.\n" +
"It’s you.\n" +
"But from the outside.\n" +
"And then it clicks.\n" +
"You were real.\n" +
"Once.\n" +
"But something broke - in the trauma.\n" +
"In the experiment.\n" +
"In the Joke.\n" +
"And to help you cope, your consciousness was fed a story - rewritten, over and over, to hide the truth:\n" +
"You were the one who caused the explosion.\n" +
"By accident.\n" +
"The lab fire. The joke gone too far.\n" +
"Aryan died saving you.\n" +
"And the rest - the mystery, the clones, Mithya, the rumors - were your mind’s way of protecting you from the truth.\n" +
"You were never a monster.\n" +
"You were a kid who made a mistake.\n" +
"\n" +
"3:33 PM - Acceptance\n" +
"You touch the screen showing the real you.\n" +
"\"Can I go back?\"\n" +
"A pause.\n" +
"Then a simple message:\n" +
"Integration possible.\n" +
"Are you ready to accept who you are?\n" +
"You hesitate.\n" +
"Then type:\n" +
"Yes.\n" +
"\n" +
"3:34 PM - Awakening\n" +
"The room fades.\n" +
"The chaos. The laughter.\n" +
"The horror of Room B-13.\n" +
"You wake up in a hospital bed.\n" +
"Doctors around you.\n" +
"Your parents weeping.\n" +
"You look in the mirror.\n" +
"No filters.\n" +
"No glitches.\n" +
"No delays.\n" +
"Just you.\n" +
"Finally.\n" +
"You are Radhe.\n" +
"Not a clone.\n" +
"Not a version.\n" +
"Not a joke.\n" +
"\n" +
"Epilogue - The Joke Ends\n" +
"Some stories were never meant to entertain.\n" +
"Some were built to heal.\n" +
"Mithya was never the villain.\n" +
"It was the name of the therapy system built to reconstruct fractured identities.\n" +
"The \"story app\"?\n" +
"It was how your mind rebuilt your memory - one scene at a time.\n" +
"And now?\n" +
"You’re ready to move forward.\n" +
"Because the final face...\n" +
"...was your own.\n"
